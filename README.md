# PoolDataLogger

This is a project for my dad that is meant to gather data about the pools pressure. It should be able to determine if the pool needs more 
water or if the pool is alright. 

Eventually, when this is complete it should get information from the pool every 30 minutes or so and determine whether the pool needs water
or not. This can eventually be built on to build new projects.
